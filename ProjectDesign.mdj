This approach will make it easier for customers to shop, sellers to manage their products, and admins to oversee the platform.\nProject Goal\nCreate a shopping platform that:\nUser Roles:\nAdmin: Has full control, including managing user accounts, overseeing all products, and performing CRUD operations on products from all sellers.\nSeller: Can add, update, and delete their products in the system, with access to their inventory and sales data.\nCustomer: Can browse products, view availability, add items to a cart, and complete purchases.\nProduct Recommendations: Offers simple recommendations for customers, such as:\nBest Sellers, Trending Products, and New Arrivals\nInventory Information: Displays clear stock availability to improve the shopping experience.\nCRUD Functionality on Products:\nAllows admins to perform full CRUD on all products and sellers to manage their listings (create, read, update, and delete products).\nCheckout Process: Provides customers with a smooth, simple checkout process.\nDesired Outcome\nImprove user satisfaction by creating a well-structured platform with tailored access for admins, sellers, and customers. This includes an easy product catalog update process, helpful product recommendations, and accurate inventory information to support user needs and platform growth.\n"
